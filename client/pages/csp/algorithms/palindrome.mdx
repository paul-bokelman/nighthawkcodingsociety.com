# Palindrome

<Like />

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward, for example, radar, toot, and madam. What needs to be done? Run a loop from starting to length/2 and check the first character to the last character of the string and second to second last one and so on …. If any character mismatches, the string wouldn’t be a palindrome.

```python /copy/
def isPalindrome(str):
        for i in range(0, int(len(str)/2)):
            if str[i] != str[len(str)-i-1]:
                return False
        return True
```

### Interactive example:

**String:** Enter a string that can or cannot pass as a palindrome.
