## Overall Project Review

### Design

- Upgraded version of the Nighthawk Society Website
- Will serve as a place for all computer science A students to come together and look over content as the trimester moves on
- Each individual page will have its own topic from the trimester, for example the original website includes a fibonacci section where there is a working fibonacci program that the student can interact with
- Upgraded version will include more content, be more responsive and have a more visually appealing theme

### Technicals

- Will have individual pages for each topic discussed throughout the trimester
- Each page will include a runnable program that is connected via the front end so the user may actually see the result ouptut
- Future introduction of a forum where students can talk to each other about problems they have encountered in their code
- Each topic such as "Databases" will have subtopics that further breakdown the overlying topic with easier to understand sections
- Background of mainpage will be fully responsive and will change seasons as they change in real life
- Will also include a news section that will feature a summary of any news that came up during class that week or any new due dates in the near future
- Best projects from the trimester will be featured on their own subpage
- Subpage that includes information on how to get different aspects of a site setup, such as a simple repository or connecting it to intelij
- Each program featured will also include code that the user may see so they can understand how the overall program works
- End result will one day be passed on to Mr. Mort himself in order to continue the legacy
